In this version of the game you must take cards from the deck and have
the total the closest as possible of 21. you must have more than 21 in total,
you will lose otherwise.

When you're done take cards, its time for the machine to take cards.
The machine also cant have more than 21 cards or it loses. When its total
is bigger than 17, its forced to stop taking cards.

When both the player and the machine are done taking cards, the game calculates
the winner. The one that have total closer from 21 wins. If both have the same
